1.  My server is the 'dev-notes' MCP server, which allows the user to use Claude or another tool
to make notes and save them, and have Claude access them for projects that they may need Claude for.  For example,
I created the note for midterm project ideas that would work in a 'low and no code class', and Claude helped me come up with ideas.
In the future, I can have Claude pull up these ideas (or I can add more details in the meantime to one or more ideas) and be able to start coding
quickly with everything mapped out already.

2.  Claude code helped me set up the server, set up the code walkthrough, and helped me debugg and figure out why the MCP server was failing to connect.
   It told me that there were broken entries and paths not defined properly.  It fixed the paths, I tested the Claude terminal with /mcp, and it finally connected.
Claude additionally helped me use the MCP, and created a note, showed which notes I had, and read out the notes to me too.  Examples effective prompts:
   
  - "can my codetour be a little more specific? explaining it for someone who has never used MCP servers before"

  - "theres a dev notes folder where my dig 4503 folder is, is that why my mcp server isnt working?"


3.  The main issues I faced were with CodeTour and with making sure that the MCP server was running.  I tried to just read the instructions over watching the tutorial,
but I was running into the problem where it wasn't making a tour because it wasn't in the dev-notes-server workspace (which the video helped guide me towards).
With setting up the MCP server, after I followed the instructions, I tried to list the MCP servers on the Claude terminal with /mcp, and noticed that my server failed.
I placed the error message into the Claude on my workspace (with the MCP server) and it caught some placeholders that I didn't see at first, and helped me correct the
pathing and get the server working.

4. An MCP is a tool that Claude or similar assistants can use to access outside programs and use in projects.  We used Nanobanana previously to generate images, and nanobanana
produced the image, and then Claude placed that image into the project.  With this local MCP server, Claude can make notes, access notes, and list notes that are in
dev-notes.  My example made a note for project ideas for the class midterm, and in the future, I or Claude can add details to these notes, and then when I need
the project idea, I can ask claude to access it and have the details ready.


5.  The only thing I would do differently is perhaps starting this assignment earlier, as it did not go as smoothly as previous assignments.  I do appreciate the deadline
extension, however.  Additionally, debugging with claude worked very well and helped solve my problem with the right questions, and removed some of the stress that I was having
from the server not working.
